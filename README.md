# Electricity fraud detection
This repository contains a case study of electricity fraud risk. 
The risk of fraud occurs when a consumer makes a clandestine conection of the unit to the street power, thus having its electricity consumption not counted by the electrity provider company.

The objective is to evaluate the probability of risk returned by a model possessed by the client, verifying if it makes sense for the objective of detecting frauds from information contained in the data.

In this work, we evaluated it using proper metrics for classification problems, also proposing other models in the attempt of getting better results than the one obtained with the model initially possessed by the client.
